# Tangerine UI for Mastodon 🍊

*README still a WIP*

Tangerine UI is a UI redesign I made for Mastodon's Web interface, using only pure CSS.

## How to use
**Tangerine UI is contained in a single CSS file.**  
To use on your instance, simply copy & paste the contents of [TangerineUI-single-colum.css](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon/blob/main/TangerineUIforMastodon-singlecolumnlayout.css) into the **Custom CSS** field in the administration panel on your Mastodon instance (Navigation to https://<your instance domain>/admin/settings/appearance).

If you're not an admin, you can still use Tangerine UI using a userstyle browser extension (ie. Stylish).

## Things to know
* This is still pretty early. Things might not be styled properly in some places. Feel free to message me if you notice anything wonky!
* **Tangerine UI only supports the single column layout for now**. Nothing will happen if you have turned on the Advanced viem (multicolumn layout).
* **Tangerine UI auto-switches from light to dark mode based on your OS preference**, whether you set your Mastodon theme to *Mastodon (Dark)* or *Mastodon (Light*).

## Credits
Huge thanks to [Roni Laukkarinen](https://mementomori.social/@rolle) whose work on [Mastodon Bird UI](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui) I adapted for multiple parts of the redesign. The icon replacements I use also come from Bird UI.
